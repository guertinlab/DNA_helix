# DNA_helix
This repository contains Adobe Illustrator DNA helix brushes and their templates. 

The approximate width of the brush is 50 pt, but it can be scaled to any width in the Pattern Brush Options by selecting any percentage and keeping the scale fixed. For example, if you wanted 14 pt you would just scale to 28%.
